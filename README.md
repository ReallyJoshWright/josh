# JOSH

This is a programming language that will be low level, developer friendly, and
modern. I am creating this language for learning purposes, but also
because I cannot seem to find a language that just works. I want a language
that is powerful and modern, while at the same time, is enjoyable to program
with.

## Attributes

### Typing
- Stronly and statically typed (with some infered typing)

### Compilation
- compiled

## Steps
- create a list of tokens and keywords
- create a lexer(tokenizer) to parse sentences into words
- create a parser to validate words and put them into an AST
